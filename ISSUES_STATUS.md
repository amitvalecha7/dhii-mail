### ✅ Issue #34: Refactor Kernel Bridge - Lazy Loading & Dynamic Discovery
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Description**: Refactored kernel plugin integration to prevent crashes from missing dependencies

**Deliverables Completed**:
- ✅ Lazy loading implementation using `importlib` to prevent eager loading crashes
- ✅ Dynamic plugin discovery via `manifest.json` files in `plugins/*` directories  
- ✅ UI route registration from plugin manifests for automatic AppShell integration
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (`test_lazy_loading.py`) with 10 test cases
- ✅ Error-resilient plugin registration with `try/except` blocks
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with legacy integration function

**Files Modified**:
- `kernel_plugin_integration.py` - Completely refactored with lazy loading
- `plugins/email/manifest.json` - Created for dynamic discovery
- `plugins/calendar/manifest.json` - Created for dynamic discovery
- `test_lazy_loading.py` - Created comprehensive test suite
- `test_lazy_loading_simple.py` - Created simple integration test

**Impact**: Kernel no longer crashes when plugins fail to load. Enables "Plug-and-Play" architecture.
